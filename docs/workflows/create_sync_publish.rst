.. _sync-publish-workflow:

Create, Sync and Publish a Repository
=====================================

One of the most common workflows is a fetching content from a remote source and making it
available for users.

Create an RPM repository ``foo``
--------------------------------

Using pulp-cli commands :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/repo_cli.sh
   :language: bash

Using httpie to talk directly to the REST API :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/repo.sh
   :language: bash

Repository GET response:

.. code:: json

    {
        "description": null,
        "latest_version_href": "/pulp/api/v3/repositories/rpm/rpm/a02ace53-d490-458d-8b93-604fbcd23a9c/versions/0/",
        "name": "foo",
        "pulp_created": "2019-11-27T13:30:28.159167Z",
        "pulp_href": "/pulp/api/v3/repositories/rpm/rpm/a02ace53-d490-458d-8b93-604fbcd23a9c/",
        "versions_href": "/pulp/api/v3/repositories/rpm/rpm/a02ace53-d490-458d-8b93-604fbcd23a9c/versions/"
    }

RPM Repositories support several additional options.

- metadata_signing_service:
    See :ref:`metadata_signing`.
- retain_package_versions:
    The maximum number of versions of each package to keep; as new versions of packages are added by upload, sync, or copy, older versions of the same packages are automatically removed. A value of 0 means "unlimited".

.. _create-remote:

Create a new remote ``bar``
---------------------------

By default ``policy='immediate`` which means that all the content is downloaded right away.
Specify ``policy='on_demand'`` to make synchronization of a repository faster and only
to download RPMs whenever they are requested by clients.

Also, you can specify ``client_cert`` and ``client_key`` if your remote require authorization with a certificate.

Using pulp-cli commands :

.. code:: shell

    pulp rpm remote create \
        --name='bar' \
        --url "${URL}" \
        --policy on_demand \
        --client-cert @./certificate.crt \
        --client-key @./certificate.key \
        --tls-validation False

Using httpie to talk directly to the REST API :

.. code:: shell

    http --form POST $BASE_ADDR/pulp/api/v3/remotes/rpm/rpm/ \
        name='bar' \
        url="$URL" \
        policy='on_demand' \
        client_cert=@./certificate.crt \
        client_key=@./certificate.key \
        tls_validation=False

If you want to use TLS validation you have to provide ``ca_cert`` too.

Using pulp-cli commands :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/remote_cli.sh
   :language: bash

Using httpie to talk directly to the REST API :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/remote.sh
   :language: bash

Remote GET response:

.. code:: json

    {
        "ca_cert": null,
        "client_cert": null,
        "client_key": null,
        "download_concurrency": 20,
        "name": "bar",
        "policy": "on_demand",
        "proxy_url": null,
        "pulp_created": "2019-11-27T13:30:29.199173Z",
        "pulp_href": "/pulp/api/v3/remotes/rpm/rpm/2ceb5262-a5b2-4297-afdf-a31f7e46dfc5/",
        "pulp_last_updated": "2019-11-27T13:30:29.199187Z",
        "tls_validation": true,
        "url": "https://fixtures.pulpproject.org/rpm-unsigned/"
    }


.. note::

   While creating a new remote, you may set the field ``url`` to point to a mirror list feed. Pulp
   fetches the list of available mirrors and tries to download content from the first valid mirror.
   This means that whenever an error occurs during the synchronization, the whole sync process ends
   with an error too.

.. _versioned-repo-created:

Configuration for SLES 12+ repository with authentication
*********************************************************

If you would like to sync SLES 12+ repository you will need to specify an authentication as ``sles_auth_token``.

You can receive your token with script like this:

.. code:: bash

    curl -H "Authorization: Token token=YourOrganizationRegistrationCode" \
    https://scc.suse.com/connect/subscriptions/products | \
    tr "," "\n" | \
    grep -i "url" | \
    grep -i "SLE-SERVER"

Assuming your token is ``YourRepositoryToken``, create the remote with the ``sles_auth_token`` specified.

Using pulp-cli commands :

.. code:: shell

    pulp rpm remote create \
        --name 'SLESrepo' \
        --url 'https://updates.suse.com/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SERVER/12/x86_64/update/' \
        --policy on_demand \
        --sles-auth-token 'YourRepositoryToken'

Using httpie to talk directly to the REST API :

.. code:: bash

    http POST :/pulp/api/v3/remotes/rpm/rpm/ \
    name='SLESrepo' \
    url='https://updates.suse.com/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SERVER/12/x86_64/update/' \
    policy='on_demand' \
    sles_auth_token='YourRepositoryToken'

.. _create-uln-remote:

Creating a ULN remote
**********************

ULN stands for "Unbreakable Linux Network" and refers to the way Oracle in particular, `delivers Oracle Linux repositories <https://linux.oracle.com/>`_ to their enterprise customers.
You can use a ULN remote to synchronize repositories from a ULN server to Pulp.
For ULN remotes you must provide your ULN login credentials via the ``username``, and ``password`` parameters, and the ``url`` is the ULN channel, e.g. ``uln://ovm2_2.1.1_i386_patch``:

Using httpie to talk directly to the REST API :

.. code:: shell

    http --form POST $BASE_ADDR/pulp/api/v3/remotes/rpm/uln/ \
        name='ULNRemote' \
        url='uln://ovm2_2.1.1_i386_patch' \
        username='example@example.com' \
        password='changeme'

Note how we are using the ``pulp/api/v3/remotes/rpm/uln/`` API endpoint, rather than ``pulp/api/v3/remotes/rpm/rpm/``.

You can also specify the ULN Server base URL for a remote using the ``uln_server_base_url`` parameter.
If you do not provide this parameter, a sync with the remote will default to the contents of the ``DEFAULT_ULN_SERVER_BASE_URL`` setting, which is ``https://linux-update.oracle.com/`` by default.
The `pulpcore configuration documentation <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/installation/configuration.html>`_ has more on how to change Pulp settings.

Once you have created a ULN remote, you can synchronize it into a RPM repository, just like you would with a RPM remote.

You may also want to consult the `Oracle ULN documentation <https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/uln-user/ol_about_uln.html>`_ for more information.


Sync repository ``foo`` using remote ``bar``
--------------------------------------------

Using pulp-cli commands :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/sync_cli.sh
   :language: bash

Using httpie to talk directly to the REST API :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/sync.sh
   :language: bash

There are 3 sync modes to choose from, using the ``sync_policy`` option.

- ``additive`` (the default) will retain the existing contents of the Pulp repository and add the contents of the remote repository being synced.
- ``mirror_content_only`` will synchronize the Pulp repository to contain the same content as the one remote repository being synced - removing any existing content that isn't present in the remote repo.
- ``mirror_complete`` will act as ``mirror_content_only`` does, but additionally it will automatically create a publication that will be an _exact_ bit-for-bit copy of the remote repository being synced, rather than requiring a separate step (or ``autopublish``) to generate the metadata later. This will keep repo metadata checksums intact, but is not possible for all repositories, as some use features which are incompatible with creating local clones that are exact copies.

The ``mirror`` option is deprecated, ``sync_policy`` should be used instead. If the ``mirror`` option is used, a value of ``true`` will change the default ``sync_policy`` to ``mirror_complete``, while a value of ``false`` will not change the default ``sync_policy``.

Optionally, you can skip ``SRPM`` packages by using ``skip_types:="[\"srpm\"]"``
option.

Optionally, you can skip kickstart-trees referred to by a parent repository by using ``skip_types:="[\"treeinfo\"]"``

You can combine these options by using by using ``skip_types:="[\"srpm\", \"treeinfo\"]"``.

By default, ``optimize=True`` and sync will only proceed if changes are present.
You can override this by setting ``optimize=False`` which will disable optimizations and
run a full sync.

.. note::

    To set up a regular sync task, use one of the external tools that deal with periodic background jobs.
    Learn more about scheduling tasks `here <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/workflows/scheduling-tasks.html>`_.


.. _publication-workflow:

Create a Publication
--------------------

A publication can only be created once a sync task completes. You can specify checksum algorithm with the following optional parameters:

- metadata_checksum_type: affects all the repodata, including primary.xml, repomd.xml, etc.
  If not specified, the default SHA256 algorithm will be used.

- package_checksum_type: affects package checksum type in all repo metadata files.
  If not specified, the default SHA256 algorithm will be used.
  Because of on_demand sync, it is possible that the requested checksum is not available.
  In such case the one from the remote repo will be used.

Using pulp-cli commands :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/publication_cli.sh
   :language: bash

Using httpie to talk directly to the REST API :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/publication.sh
   :language: bash

Publication GET response (when task complete):

.. code:: json

    {
        "publisher": null,
        "pulp_created": "2019-11-27T13:30:36.006972Z",
        "pulp_href": "/pulp/api/v3/publications/rpm/rpm/c90316fc-bf2a-458a-93b8-d3d75614572f/",
        "repository": "/pulp/api/v3/repositories/rpm/rpm/a02ace53-d490-458d-8b93-604fbcd23a9c/",
        "repository_version": "/pulp/api/v3/repositories/rpm/rpm/a02ace53-d490-458d-8b93-604fbcd23a9c/versions/1/"
    }

The GPG signature check options, like ``gpgcheck`` and ``repo_gpgcheck`` are configurable via the ``repo_config`` option.
This option has a json format and can contain any of the configuration for the ``.repo`` file.

We encourage users to take a look at the `pulp_rpm API documentation <../restapi.html#operation/publications_rpm_rpm_create>`_
to see the default values for these options.


Create a Distribution for the Publication
-----------------------------------------
Using pulp-cli commands :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/distribution_cli.sh
   :language: bash

Using httpie to talk directly to the REST API :

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/distribution.sh
   :language: bash

Distribution GET response (when task complete):

.. code:: json

    {
        "base_path": "foo",
        "base_url": "http://pulp3-source-fedora30.pavels-macbook-pro.example.com/pulp/content/foo",
        "content_guard": null,
