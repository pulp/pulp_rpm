Mirror a Remote Repository
==========================

This is an example of creating a local mirror of a remote repository. In this
case, we will mirror the `Foreman <http://theforeman.org/>`_ repository.

::

  $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=foreman --feed=http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.1/el6/x86_64/ --relative-url=foreman
  Successfully created repository [foreman]

* ``--repo-id`` is required and must be unique.
* ``--relative-url`` is optional and was used here to make the path to the repository
  friendlier.
* ``--feed`` is only required if you want to sync content from an external yum
  repository, which in this case we do.

::

  $ pulp-admin rpm repo sync run --repo-id=foreman
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                   Synchronizing Repository [foreman]
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  This command may be exited by pressing ctrl+c without affecting the actual
  operation on the server.

The full URL to a published repository is derived from the following information:
 * The server name of the Pulp server. This should be the same hostname used in the
   CN of the server's SSL certificate, otherwise SSL verification on the client
   will likely fail. The configuration of that certificate is handled by Apache,
   typically in the ``ssl.conf`` configuration file.
 * The Apache alias at which Pulp RPM repositories are hosted. This value is set
   in the ``pulp_rpm.conf`` file located in Apache's ``conf.d`` directory. By
   default, this is set to ``/pulp/repos``.
 * The relative URL of the repository being published. This can be explicitly set
   when the repository is created in Pulp. If it is not explicitly set, Pulp will
   derive this value using the relative URL of the repository's feed. For feedless
   repositories, the repository ID is used.

Applying these rules to the above example repository, the published repository
can be found (adjusting the hostname as necessary) at:
`https://localhost/pulp/repos/foreman/ <https://localhost/pulp/repos/foreman/>`_.

Had the relative URL not been explicitly set in the repository, the hosted URL
would be:
``https://localhost/pulp/repos/releases/1.1/el6/x86_64/``.

To keep the repository current, it might be desirable to synchronize it on a
regular schedule. The following command sets a schedule of synchronizing once
a day.

::

  $ pulp-admin rpm repo sync schedules create -s '2012-12-15T00:00Z/P1D' --repo-id=foreman
  Schedule successfully created


.. _configure-proxy:

Use a Proxy
===========

Using a web proxy is fairly straight-forward. Proxy details are specified when
creating the repository, as in this example:

::

  $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=foo --proxy-host=http://bar.net \
  --proxy-port=1234 --proxy-user=me --proxy-pass=letmein \
  --feed=http://bar.net/repos/foo/
  Successfully created repository [foo]

.. warning::
  The password is stored in clear text and may be presented in clear text by the
  command line utility. Do not use sensitive credentials for your web proxy.

Alternatively, Pulp can be configured to use a specific proxy for all yum
repositories by adding the following settings to
``/etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/yum_importer.json``

::

  {
   "proxy_host" : "<url>",
   "proxy_port" : <port>,
   "proxy_username" : "<username>",
   "proxy_password" : "<password>"
  }

.. note:: This is a JSON file, so care must be taken when editing it.


Sync a Protected Repo
=====================

Syncing against a protected repository requires specifying some SSL certificates.
The ``pulp-admin rpm repo create`` command does a good job of documenting these
options, but the below example may help pull it all together.

This example was run on a RHEL6 server with an active subscription.

Note that you will need to adjust the file names for the certificate and key in
``/etc/pki/`` to match your own. Also note that this needs to run as root to
have permission to read the certificates and key.

::

  $ sudo pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=rhel-6-server \
  --feed=https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/rhel/server/6/6Server/x86_64/os \
  --feed-ca-cert=/etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem --feed-cert=/etc/pki/entitlement/8435737662014631983.pem \
  --feed-key=/etc/pki/entitlement/8435737662014631983-key.pem
  Successfully created repository [rhel6server]

  $ pulp-admin rpm repo sync run --repo-id=rhel6server
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                   Synchronizing Repository [rhel6server]
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  This command may be exited by pressing ctrl+c without affecting the actual
  operation on the server.

  Downloading metadata...
  [/]
  ... completed

  RPMs:       91/8769 items
  Delta RPMs: 0/0 items

If you would prefer not to use the entitlement certificates from an existing
RHEL installation, you can also acquire the entitlement certificate, key, and
`CA certificate <https://access.redhat.com/management/ca_cert/download>`_ using
the Red Hat Customer Portal. To retrieve the entitlement certificate and key,
you will need to view your
`Registered Consumers <https://access.redhat.com/management/consumers/>`_. On
that page, there is a "Systems" tab, and in that tab there is a link to
`Register a system <https://access.redhat.com/management/consumer/consumers/create/system>`_.
Fill out the form with the relevant details for your Pulp Server, and click
"Register". Once you have registered your system, you must now attach a
subscription to it with the "Attach a subscription" link on the page for the
newly registered system. In the pop up, select the subscriptions that you want
to apply to the Pulp Server and click "Attach selected". You will now see the
selected subscriptions in the "Attached Subscriptions" table, and you can use
the "Download" link from the "Entitlement Certificate" column to retrieve the
certificate and key, bundled into a single file. You can pass that same file as
the ``--feed-cert`` and ``--feed-key`` options when you create the repo.

.. _export-repos:

Export Repositories and Repository Groups
=========================================

If you have a Pulp server that does not have access to the Internet, it is possible
to use a second Pulp server, which does have Internet access, to retrieve repositories and
repository updates for your disconnected server. The full list of options can be seen by
running ``pulp-admin rpm repo export run --help``.

The general workflow is as follows:

1. Use the connected Pulp server to sync one or more repositories.
2. Export these repositories to ISOs: ``pulp-admin rpm repo export run --repo-id=demo-repo``

::

  $ pulp-admin rpm repo export run --repo-id=demo-repo
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                        Publishing Repository [demo-repo]
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  This command may be exited by pressing ctrl+c without affecting the actual
  operation on the server.

Which, if publishing over HTTP, could be found at
`http://localhost/pulp/exports/repo/demo-repo/ <http://localhost/pulp/exports/repo/demo-repo/>`_
(adjust hostname and repo-id as necessary.)

3. Transport the ISOs to the disconnected Pulp server
4. Mount each ISO and copy its contents to a directory on the disconnected Pulp server

::

  $ cp -r /path/to/mounted/iso1/ /path/to/extracted/content
  $ cp -r /path/to/mounted/iso2/ /path/to/extracted/content

5. On the disconnected Pulp server, create a new repository with the feed pointing at
   the directory containing the ISO contents:
   ``pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=demo-repo --feed=file:///path/to/extracted/content/``
6. Sync the repository using ``pulp-admin rpm repo sync run --repo-id=demo-repo``

The workflow for exporting repository groups is quite similar. The command is
``pulp-admin rpm repo group export run``. Repository groups can contain any content type,
but this command will only export the yum repositories.

It is also possible to export all rpms and errata associated with a repository in a given
time frame using the ``--start-date`` and ``--end-date`` options. This is helpful if you have
already exported the repository and would like to only export updates. Be aware that since this
does not export package groups or categories, any updates to these will not be reflected on the
disconnected Pulp server. There is currently no support in the pulp-admin command-line utility
for uploading these incremental updates back into Pulp; you must use the REST API for these uploads.

.. warning::
  It is very important keep track of the last time you performed an incremental export.
  If you fail use the correct date range, some dependencies may be missing from the export.
  It is recommended that you overlap the date ranges to be safe.

The default behavior is to create a set of ISO images and publish them over
HTTP or HTTPS to ``/pulp/exports/repo/<repo-id>/``, or if publishing a repo
group, ``/pulp/exports/repo_group/<group-id>/``. The default image size will
fit on a DVD (4308MB). However, if you would prefer to use an external hard drive
to transport the repositories, you can use the ``--export-dir`` option, which will
export the repository to a directory on the Pulp server rather than creating a set
of ISOs and publishing them over HTTP or HTTPS. If you choose this option, simply
skip step 4.


Errata
======

.. _search-errata:

Searching for Errata
--------------------

Pulp has a very powerful search interface that can be used to search content
units. In this recipe, you will learn how to use it to search for errata that
have been issued on or after a date, and also how to search for errata by type.
Let's start by defining a repo cleverly called ``repo`` with a demo feed::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=repo \
      --feed=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/demo_repos/pulp_unittest/ \
      --relative-url=repo
    Successfully created repository [repo]

Now let's sync the repo so it has some errata for us to search::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo sync run --repo-id=repo

The contents of our example repository are from a few years ago, but it includes
errata over a span of a few years. Suppose that I wanted to know which errata
were issued on or after December 1, 2009. For this example, I will include the
``--fields=id`` flag to limit the output to just be the IDs of the errata, but
you can season that flag to taste, or omit it if you want to see everything::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo content errata --filters='{"issued": {"$gte": "2009-12-01"}}' \
      --repo-id=repo --fields=id
    Id: RHBA-2010:0010

    Id: RHBA-2010:0205

    Id: RHBA-2010:0206

    Id: RHBA-2010:0222

    Id: RHBA-2010:0251

    Id: RHBA-2010:0281

    Id: RHBA-2010:0282

    Id: RHBA-2010:0294

    Id: RHBA-2010:0418

We already talked about the ``--fields=id`` flag, so let's focus on the
``--filters='{"issued": {"$gte": "2009-12-01"}}'`` flag. :command:`pulp-admin`
has some built in simple filtering capabilities, but they aren't as powerful as
the filtering we can achieve with the ``--filters`` flag. We can use this flag
to pass a `JSON filter <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operators/>`_
to MongoDB to have it apply any arbitrary filter we want. In our case, we want
to look for the "issued" field of our errata being greater than or equal to
2009-12-01.

There are three different types of errata: Security Advisories (RHSAs), Bug Fix
Advisories (RHBAs), and Product Enhancement Advisories (RHEAs). Suppose we
wanted to know which RHSAs were available in a repo. We would run this command::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo content errata --match type=security \
      --repo-id=repo --fields=id
    Id: RHSA-2007:0114

    Id: RHSA-2007:0323

    Id: RHSA-2008:0194

    Id: RHSA-2008:0892

    Id: RHSA-2009:0003

    Id: RHSA-2009:0382

    Id: RHSA-2009:1472

For this command we asked Pulp to find errata that had their type field set to
"security". We can also find these by applying a regex to the id field::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo content errata \
      --match id=^RHSA --repo-id=repo

In this example, we asked MongoDB to look for errata that had an ``id`` that
matched our supplied
`Regular Expression <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operators/#_S_regex>`_.
The carat at the start of our regular expression will match the beginning of the
``id`` field, and we used RHSA after that to make sure the ID was an RHSA and
not an RHBA or RHEA.

.. _copy-errata-recipe:

Copy Errata From One Repository to Another
------------------------------------------

The :command:`pulp-admin` utility can be used to copy errata from one repository to
another. In this recipe, we will create two repositories, sync one with a
sample upstream repository, and then copy an erratum from it to the other.
Let's begin by creating our two repositories, ``repo_1`` and ``repo_2``::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=repo_1 \
      --feed=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/demo_repos/pulp_unittest/ \
      --relative-url=repo_1
    Successfully created repository [repo_1]

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=repo_2 \
      --relative-url=repo_2
    Successfully created repository [repo_2]
    
Next, we will sync ``repo_1``, so that it will have some errata that we can
copy::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo sync run --repo-id=repo_1
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    Synchronizing Repository [repo_1]
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    This command may be exited by pressing ctrl+c without affecting the actual
    operation on the server.

    Publishing repository over HTTP
    [-]
    ... skipped

Now ``repo_1`` has errata and other units, and ``repo_2`` has no units at all.
Suppose that we would like to pull all of the security updates from ``repo_1``
to ``repo_2``. We can determine which errata are RHSA by using a match filter::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo content errata --match type=security \
      --repo-id=repo_1 --fields=id
    Id: RHSA-2007:0114

    Id: RHSA-2007:0323

    Id: RHSA-2008:0194

    Id: RHSA-2008:0892

    Id: RHSA-2009:0003

    Id: RHSA-2009:0382

    Id: RHSA-2009:1472

Running that same command for ``repo_2`` doesn't show any errata, so let's use
the unit copy command to bring these RHSAs over, but not the RHBAs or the
RHEAs::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo copy errata --match type=security \
      --from-repo-id=repo_1 --to-repo-id=repo_2
    Progress on this task can be viewed using the commands under "repo tasks".

We can inspect the progress of this operation using
``pulp-admin repo tasks list --repo-id=repo_1``. There are only a few
errata to be copied here so it should be complete shortly. Now we can inspect
the contents of ``repo_2``::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo content errata --repo-id=repo_2 --fields=id
    Id: RHSA-2007:0114

    Id: RHSA-2007:0323

    Id: RHSA-2008:0194

    Id: RHSA-2008:0892

    Id: RHSA-2009:0003

    Id: RHSA-2009:0382

    Id: RHSA-2009:1472

.. _create-errata-recipe:

Create Your Own Errata
----------------------

You can also create your own errata on a repo using the Pulp client. In order to
do this, you will need to create a few
`CSV <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_ files and provide a
few data fields to the :command:`pulp-admin` client.

Let's begin by making a repo and syncing it::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=repo \
      --feed=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/demo_repos/pulp_unittest/
    Successfully created repository [repo]

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo sync run --repo-id=repo

Now let's create a new errata that references one of the test packages from this
repo called pulp-test-package. The first file that we will need to provide is a
references CSV file. This CSV should have four columns: href, type, id, and
description, giving a link to the referenced bug report or CVE, the type of the
reference, the ID of the reference, and a brief description. Here is an example,
named references.csv, wherein you can see that pulp-test-package-0.2.1 has some
serious issues::

    http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=123456,bugzilla,123456,pulp-test-package-0.2.1 prints mean error messages to users
    http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=654321,bugzilla,654321,pulp-test-package-0.2.1 causes users' machines to run out of bits/bytes/whatever. The users must wait until the next supply comes next week

Next, we will need to provide a list of packages that the errata applies to.
This CSV provides a list of packages that address the issue that the errata
tracks with the following columns: name, version, release, epoch, arch,
filename, checksum, checksum_type, and src. For example, let's create
package_list.csv for this::

    pulp-test-package,0.3.1,1.fc11,0,x86_64,pulp-test-package-0.3.1-1.fc11.x86_64.rpm,6bce3f26e1fc0fc52ac996f39c0d0e14fc26fb8077081d5b4dbfb6431b08aa9f,sha256,pulp-test-package-0.3.1-1.fc11.src.rpm

Now that we have these two files, we can create our new errata like so::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo uploads erratum --erratum_id=DEMO_ID_1 \
      --title="1: pulp-test-package bit conservation" \
      --description="1: pulp-test-package now conserves your precious bits." \
      --version=1 --release="el6" --type="bugzilla" --status="final" \
      --updated="`date`" --issued="`date`" --reference-csv=references.csv \
      --pkglist-csv=package_list.csv --from=pulp-list@redhat.com --repo-id=repo
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                  Unit Upload

And now we are able to see that our errata is part of the repo::

Package Groups
==============

.. _creating_package_groups:

Create Your Own Package Groups
------------------------------

You can easily define your own package groups with the :command:`pulp_admin`
utility. Let's create and sync a repo::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=repo_1 \
      --feed=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/demo_repos/pulp_unittest/
    Successfully created repository [repo_1]

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo sync run --repo-id=repo_1

Now let's build a package group for our demo repo test files::

   $ pulp-admin rpm repo uploads group --repo-id=repo_1 --group-id=pulp_test \
     --name="Pulp Test" --description="A package group of Pulp test files." \
     --mand-name=pulp-dot-2.0-test --mand-name=pulp-test-package
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                 Unit Upload

Copying Package Groups Between Repos
------------------------------------

Package groups can be copied from one repository to another, which will bring
along the packages it references as well. For this example, we will assume
you've performed the steps from the :ref:`creating_package_groups` section.

We'll begin by creating a new empty repo, ``repo_2``::

   $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=repo_2
   Successfully created repository [repo_2]

And now we will copy our package group, ``pulp_test`` from ``repo_1`` to
``repo_2``::

   $ pulp-admin rpm repo copy group --match id=pulp_test --from-repo-id=repo_1 \
     --to-repo-id=repo_2
   Progress on this task can be viewed using the commands under "repo tasks".

This task should complete fairly quickly since there isn't much to do with our
tiny example repo, but we can check on the progress to verify that it is
finished::

    $ pulp-admin repo tasks list --repo-id=repo_1
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                     Tasks
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Operations:  associate
    Resources:   repo_2 (repository), repo_1 (repository)
    State:       Successful
    Start Time:  2012-12-20T16:26:44Z
    Finish Time: 2012-12-20T16:26:44Z
    Result:      N/A
    Task Id:     9f1d0146-cc28-47a8-b0f4-b1b49f84e058

Now we can inspect ``repo_2`` and see that the package group and its RPMs have
been copied there::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo content group --repo-id=repo_2
    Conditional Package Names:
    Default:                   False
    Default Package Names:     None

Package Categories
==================

.. _creating_package_categores:

Create Your Own Package Categories
----------------------------------

You can also define your own package categories with the :command:`pulp_admin`
utility. Let's create and sync a repo::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=repo_1 \
      --feed=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/demo_repos/pulp_unittest/
    Successfully created repository [repo_1]

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo sync run --repo-id=repo_1

Now let's build two package groups for our demo repo test files::

   $ pulp-admin rpm repo uploads group --repo-id=repo_1 \
     --group-id=pulp_test_packages --name="Pulp Test Packages" \
     --description="A package group of Pulp test files." \
     --mand-name=pulp-dot-2.0-test --mand-name=pulp-test-package

   $ pulp-admin rpm repo uploads group --repo-id=repo_1 \
     --group-id=pulp_dotted_name_packages --name="Pulp Dotted Name Packages" \
     --description="A group of packages that have dots in their names." \
     --mand-name=pulp-dot-2.0-test

And now we can easily create a package category that is a collection of these
two groups::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo uploads category --repo-id=repo_1 \
      --category-id=example_category --name="Example Category" \
      --description="An Example Category" --group=pulp_test_packages \
      --group=pulp_dotted_name_packages
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                  Unit Upload
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Starting upload of selected units. If this process is stopped through ctrl+c,
    the uploads will be paused and may be resumed later using the resume command or
    cancelled entirely using the cancel command.

    Importing into the repository...
    ... completed

    Deleting the upload request...
    ... completed

The package category details can be listed as well::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo content category --repo-id=repo_1 \
      --match id=example_category
    Description:            An Example Category
    Display Order:          0
    Id:                     example_category
    Name:                   Example Category
    Packagegroupids:        pulp_test_packages, pulp_dotted_name_packages
    Repo Id:                repo_1
    Translated Description:

Copying Package Categories
--------------------------

Like package groups, categories can be copied between repos, which will bring
along their groups and packages. Assuming you've performed the steps from the
:ref:`creating_package_categores` section, let's begin by creating an empty
second repo::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo create --repo-id=repo_2
    Successfully created repository [repo_2]

Now let's copy ``example_category`` from ``repo_1`` to ``repo_2``::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo copy category --match id=example_category \
      --from-repo-id=repo_1 --to-repo-id=repo_2
    Progress on this task can be viewed using the commands under "repo tasks".

We should check out the task to see when it's done with the repo tasks command::

    $ pulp-admin repo tasks list --repo-id=repo_1
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                     Tasks
    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Operations:  associate
    Resources:   repo_2 (repository), repo_1 (repository)
    State:       Successful
    Start Time:  2012-12-20T20:41:12Z
    Finish Time: 2012-12-20T20:41:12Z
    Result:      N/A
    Task Id:     b5139389-b985-40be-8ee5-10bc626a124a

And now we can see that ``repo_2`` has the category, groups, and RPMs::

    $ pulp-admin rpm repo content category --repo-id=repo_2
    Description:            An Example Category
    Display Order:          0
    Id:                     example_category
    Name:                   Example Category

Chili
=====

* 2 lb. Ground Beef
* Chili Powder
* Garlic
* 1 Large Onion
* 2 Cans of Tomatoes
* 4 Cans of beans (mix & match!)
* Habanero Peppers (be careful)
* Jalapeño Peppers
* 2 Bell Peppers

Put the meat, onion, powder, and tomatoes in a crock pot. Chop up all the vegetables. Put half the
vegetables and put those in the crock pot, save the rest for later in the fridge. Turn the crock pot
on for several (4-10) hours. After it is done, stir in the remaining vegetables and beans. Cook on
high for 30 minutes.
