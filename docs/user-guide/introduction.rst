Introduction
============

RPM Support for Pulp allows you to create and publish repositories of RPM
packages (including RPM, SRPM, DRPM, errata, and distributions).

* Automatically retrieve packages from external repositories and store them in
  local Pulp repositories, which are hosted by the Pulp server.
* Upload your own packages and errata into local Pulp repositories.
* Copy packages and errata from one local repository to another, enabling you to promote
  testing versions to a production repository.
* Push packages out to large numbers of consumers.
* Track from the server what packages are installed on each consumer.
