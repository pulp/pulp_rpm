Pulp 2.4 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.4.0
==========

New Features
------------

-  When a pulp_manifest.xml is added to kickstart repositories all of the additional files listed
   in the manifest will be downloaded as part of the repo. The command line utility available
   at pulp_rpm/playpen/yum_distributor/generate_distribution_manifest.py can be used to help with
   creating the manifest file. This file should be stored as a peer of the treeinfo file in a source
   repository that is being synced by Pulp.
 - Added the ability to generate sqlite repository metadata files as part of an RPM repo
   publish.


API Changes
-----------
 - The ``generate_sqlite`` metadata flag was added to the yum_distributor distributor type.
   Enabling that flag will turn on generation of sqlite repo metadata files.  This is not
   enabled by default.
 - Removed the ``use_createrepo`` in favor of the more precise ``generate_sqlite`` flag

Yum Importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When uploading RPMs, the unit key and metadata no longer need to be extracted client-side
and passed to the server. The server will inspect the RPM and extract the necessary information.

Yum metadata files can now be uploaded to a repository. Information on valid metadata
attributes can be found in the technical reference.

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

 - pulp_rpm has added a dependency on python-lxml for xml parsing

Please see the
`Pulp Platform upgrade instructions <https://pulp-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/pulp-2.4/release-notes.html>`_
for information on how to complete the upgrade.

Known Issues
------------
There is a bug where if you have migrated from Pulp 2.0 or earlier of to any version prior to 2.4
and are performing a second migration to 2.4 or greater you may encounter an error that
``Applying migration pulp_rpm.plugins.migrations.0003_custom_metadata_on_scratchpad failed``.
This is caused because of old data that is no longer needed.
The following command can be used to remove the data that is no longer needed:
``find /var/lib/pulp/working/repos/ -path '*/yum_importer' -type d -exec rm -rf '{}' \;``
