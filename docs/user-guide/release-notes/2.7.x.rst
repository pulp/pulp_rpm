Pulp 2.7 Release Notes

Pulp 2.7.0
==========

New Features
------------

The repo authentication functionality associated with pulp_rpm has been moved
into platform. This allows other plugins to take advantage of this
functionality.

The sync process checks the revision number in upstream metadata to determine if it has changed
since the previous sync. If not, most steps in the sync will be skipped. On large repositories,
this has reduced best-case sync times from an order of minutes to a few seconds.
