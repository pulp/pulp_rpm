Pulp 2.7 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.7.0
==========

New Features
------------

* The repo authentication functionality associated with pulp_rpm has been moved
  into platform. This allows other plugins to take advantage of this
  functionality.

* The RPM plugin supports basic auth when fetching data from upstream repos.
  This can be configured via ``basicauth-user`` and ``basicauth-pass`` when
  creating or updating a repository.

* The export distributor can optionally create a PULP_MANIFEST file in the directory where
  ISOs are generated. This allows the pulp ISO importer to directly import the published product.
  See the help text for ``pulp-admin rpm repo sync run``, or the distributor documentation for
  details.
