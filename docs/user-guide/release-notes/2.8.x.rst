Database Changes
----------------

The database has renamed some field names for RPM unit models. This change should not be noticeable through the API,
but it does come with a migration which drops some indexes. The following field names are renamed:

=========================  ==============  ======================
Collection                 Old Field Name  New Field Name
=========================  ==============  ======================
units_distribution         id              distribution_id
units_erratum              from            errata_from
units_erratum              id              errata_id
units_package_group        id              package_group_id
units_package_category     id              package_category_id
units_package_environment  id              package_environment_id
=========================  ==============  ======================


The following indexes have been dropped:

=========================  ==============
Collection                 Index Name
=========================  ==============
units_distribution         id_1
units_distribution         id_1_family_1_variant_1_version_1_arch_1
units_erratum              id_1
units_package_group        id_1
units_package_group        id_1_repo_id_1
units_package_category     id_1
units_package_category     id_1_repo_id_1
units_package_environment  id_1
units_package_environment  id_1_repo_id_1
=========================  ==============

Several indexes have been created, check your db to see what indexes are in place.
