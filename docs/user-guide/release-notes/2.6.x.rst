Pulp 2.6 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.6.2
==========

New Behaviors
-------------

The sync process checks the revision number in upstream metadata to determine
if it has changed since the previous sync. If not, most steps in the sync will
be skipped. On large repositories, this has reduced best-case sync times from
an order of minutes to a few seconds.

Bug Fixes
---------

Pulp 2.6.1
==========

New Behaviors

Syncing of erratum from Scientific Linux repositories is now working.

Pulp 2.6.0
==========

New Behaviors

When doing a ``sync`` operation, if the upstream "distribution" unit has not
changed since the last sync, pulp will no longer attempt to download additional
distribution-related files.

`RHBZ #1153378 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1153378>`_ was addressed in 2.6.0. If
you have older (circa 2009) yum clients that fail in a way similar to what is described
`in this bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=647828#c1>`_, you may want to temporarily
re-enable ``SSLInsecureRenegotation`` under ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp_rpm.conf`` until your client
systems have been updated.
