Pulp 2.16.0

New Features
------------

* A new pulp-manifest tool that can be used to create PULP_MANIFEST for a
  directory that the user plans to use the iso importer with.

* Add support for SUSE Errata format. This includes the addition of two new
  fields on the Erratum model: `relogin_suggested` and `restart_suggested`.
  Errata update logic has been modified so that if two Errata has the same `updated`
  timestamp we also check to see if the `version` field has been updated.

* Added the ability to use different GPG signing keys for repository metadata.
  To accomplish this, users can specify a key in the distributor configuration
  and change the GPG signing command to know how to process it.
  More information can be found in `GPG Signing Key https://docs.pulpproject.org/plugins/pulp_rpm/tech-reference/yum-plugins.html#gpg-signing-key`
