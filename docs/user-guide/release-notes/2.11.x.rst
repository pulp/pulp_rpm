Pulp 2.11 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.11.0
===========

New Features
------------

* Added support for uploading DRPMs via `pulp-admin rpm repo uploads drpm` or via API.
* A full sync will be forced if the sync configuration has been changed or content has been removed
  since the last sync.
* The yum_importer can sync a distribution unit even when no yum metadata is present in the repo.
  This is useful for kickstart trees related to Project Atomic.
* Added support for publishing ISO repositories to custom relative paths.
* RPMs are now being published into new folder structure e.g. "Packages/d/dnf.rpm". This applies
  to all RPMs which will be published after this update, even during incremental publish in a repo
  with the old folder structure. Incremental publishes will place newly-added RPMs into
  the new folder structure while leaving previously-published RPMs in the old locations. This is
  safe and correct. If you prefer to have all RPMs published in the new layout, simply perform
  a full publish on each repository.
