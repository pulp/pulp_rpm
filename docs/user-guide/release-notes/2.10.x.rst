Pulp 2.10 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.10.0
===========

New Features
------------

* The yum distributor and export distributor now can use the configured checksum type for
  updateinfo.xml generation which may differ from the configured checksum type for all
  repo metadata. It can be specified via pulp-admin repo "create" and "update" commands.

* Full re-sync can be done now using ``--force-full`` option.

* The RPM rsync distributor has been added. The new distributor can be used to publish repositories
  published by yum_distributor to a remote server.

* Package signature filtering can be enabled. There are two new options that are responsible
  for signature filter behaviour ``--require-signature`` and ``--allowed-keys``. These options can
  be specified via pulp-admin repo "create" and "update" commands, or via API by specifing them in
  the importer configuration. More details can be found in `RPM Features
  <http://docs.pulpproject.org/user-guide/features.html#package-signatures-and-gpg-key-id-filtering>`_ or in
  `Recipes <http://docs.pulpproject.org/user-guide/recipes.html#sync-a-repo-with-gpg-key-id-filtering>`_.
