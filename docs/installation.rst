.. _ansible-installation:

Install with pulp_installer (recommended)
-----------------------------------------

Only Fedora 29+ and CentOS 7+ are supported.

pulpcore provides an `Ansible Installer <https://galaxy.ansible.com/pulp/pulp_installer>`_ that can be used to
install ``pulp_rpm``. For example if your host is in your Ansible inventory as ``myhost`` you
can install onto it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.postgresql
   ansible-galaxy collection install pulp.pulp_installer

Create your pulp_rpm.yml playbook to use with the installer:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - hosts: all
      vars:
        pulp_settings:
          secret_key: << YOUR SECRET HERE >>
          content_origin: "http://{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
        pulp_default_admin_password: << YOUR PASSWORD HERE >>
        pulp_install_plugins:
          pulp-rpm: {}
        roles:
          - pulp.pulp_installer.pulp_all_services
        environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pulpcore.app.settings

Then install it onto ``myhost`` with:

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-playbook pulp_pm.yml -l myhost


Pip install

Install ``pulpcore``
********************

Follow the `installation
instructions <https://docs.pulpproject.org/installation/instructions.html>`__
provided with pulpcore.

Install prerequisites
*********************

Install build dependencies
##########################

``pulp_rpm`` depends on some C libraries that must be compiled from source as Python extentions. Unfortunately,
some of these packages are only available as Python "source distributions", meaning that they must be compiled
on your own machine. But, luckily, you won't have to do that yourself! Simply install the build dependencies
on your machine and the build process itself will happen behind the scenes when you install the packages.

Caveat: Unfortunately, a fully-featured ``createrepo_c`` can only be built on Red Hat based distros,
as not all of its build dependencies are available on Debian-based platforms.

If you are on Fedora, install the build dependencies with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo dnf install -y gcc make cairo-devel cairo-gobject-devel cmake bzip2-devel expat-devel file-devel glib2-devel gobject-introspection-devel libcurl-devel libmodulemd-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel python3-devel rpm-devel sqlite-devel xz-devel zchunk-devel zlib-devel

If on CentOS or RHEL, use this commands:

Ensure you have enabled ``epel`` and ``powertools`` (in RHEL it is ``CodeReady``) repositories

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install -y epel-release
    sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools
    # sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum install -y gcc make cairo-devel cairo-gobject-devel cmake bzip2-devel expat-devel file-devel glib2-devel gobject-introspection-devel libcurl-devel libmodulemd-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel python3-devel rpm-devel sqlite-devel swig xz-devel zchunk-devel zlib-devel



Ensure your virtual environment uses system wide packages
#########################################################

``pyevn.cfg`` can be found usually in ``/usr/local/lib/pulp/`` as root directory of virtual environment.

.. code-block:: bash

    grep "include-system-site-packages" pyvenv.cfg

You should get ``include-system-site-packages = true``.

This is a necessary prerequisite for ``libmodulemd`` and ``libcomps`` along with the build dependencies listed
above for ``createrepo_c``.

Install Python build dependencies (CentOS / RHEL only)
######################################################

Users on CentOS or RHEL must manually install the Python build dependencies for createrepo_c and libcomps.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo -u pulp -i
   source ~/pulpvenv/bin/activate
   pip install scikit-build nose

Install ``pulp_rpm``
********************

Users should install from **either** PyPI or source or use pulp_installer installer.
In case of PyPI or source installation in virtual environment make sure the environment
has enabled usage of system wide packages. You can achieve that with flag ``--system-site-packages``
at environment creation time or with option in ``pyvenv.cfg`` file in root directory of virtual environment.


Install ``pulp-rpm`` From PyPI
##############################

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo -u pulp -i
   source ~/pulpvenv/bin/activate
   pip install pulp-rpm

Install ``pulp_rpm`` from source
################################

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo -u pulp -i
   source ~/pulpvenv/bin/activate
   git clone https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm.git
   cd pulp_rpm
   pip install -e .

Run Migrations
**************

.. code-block:: bash

   django-admin migrate rpm

Run Services

.. code-block:: bash

   django-admin runserver 24817
   gunicorn pulpcore.content:server --bind 'localhost:24816' --worker-class 'aiohttp.GunicornWebWorker' -w 2
   sudo systemctl restart pulpcore-resource-manager
