Yum Importer
============

The Yum Importer can be used to sync an RPM repository with an upstream feed. The Yum Importer ID is
``yum_importer``.

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

The following options are available to the yum importer configuration. All
configuration values are optional.

``feed``
 URL where the repository's content will be synchronized from. This can be either
 an HTTP URL or a location on disk represented as a file URL.

``ssl_validation``
 Indicates if the server's SSL certificate is verified against the CA certificate
 uploaded. The certificate should be verified against the CA for each client request.
 Has no effect for non-SSL feeds. Valid values to this option are ``True`` and ``False``;
 defaults to ``True``.

``ssl_ca_cert``
 CA certificate string used to validate the feed source's SSL certificate (for feeds
 exposed over HTTPS). This option is ignored if ``ssl_verify`` is false.

``ssl_client_cert``
 Certificate used as the client certificate when synchronizing the repository.
 This is used to communicate authentication information to the feed source.
 The value to this option must be the full path to the certificate. The specified
 file may be the certificate itself or a single file containing both the certificate
 and private key.

``ssl_client_key``
 Private key to the certificate specified in ``ssl_client_cert``, assuming it is not
 included in the certificate file itself.

``proxy_host``
 Indicates the URL to use as a proxy server when synchronizing this repository.

``proxy_port``
 Port to connect to on the proxy server.

``proxy_username``
 Username to pass to the proxy server if it requires authentication.

``proxy_password``
 Password to use for proxy server authentication.

``basic_auth_username``
 Username to pass to the feed URL's server if it requires authentication.

``basic_auth_password``
 Password to use for server authentication.

``max_speed``
 The maximum download speed in bytes/sec for a task (such as a sync);
 defaults to None

``validate``
 If True, as the repository is synchronized the checksum of each file will be
 verified against the metadata's expectation. Valid values to this option are
 ``True`` and ``False``; defaults to ``False``.

``max_downloads``
 Number of threads used when synchronizing the repository. This count controls
 the download threads themselves and has no bearing on the number of operations
 the Pulp server can execute at a given time; defaults to ``1``.

``remove_missing``
 If true, as the repository is synchronized, old rpms will be removed. Valid values
 to this option are ``True`` and ``False``; defaults to ``False``

``retain_old_count``
 Count indicating how many old rpm versions to retain; defaults to 0. This count
 only takes effect when ``remove_old`` option is set to ``True``.

``purge_orphaned``
 If True, as the repository is synchronized, packages no longer available from the
 source repository will be deleted; defaults to ``True``.

``skip``
  List of content types to be skipped during the repository synchronization.
  If unspecified, all types will be synchronized. Valid values are: rpm, drpm,
  distribution, errata, packagegroup; default is [].

``checksum_type``
 checksum type to use for metadata generation; defaults to source checksum type of ``sha256``.

``num_retries``
 Number of times to retry before declaring an error during repository synchronization;
 defaults to ``2``.

``copy_children``
 Supported only as an override config option to a repository copy command, when
 this option is False, the copy command will not attempt to locate and copy child
 packages of errata, groups, or categories. For example, if it is already known
 that all of a group's RPMs are available in the destination repository, it can
 save substantial time to set this to False and thus not have the importer verify
 the presence of each. default is True.

Yum Distributor
===============

The Yum Distributor ID is ``yum_distributor``.

Configuration Parameters 
------------------------

The following options are available to the Yum Distributor configuration.

Required Configuration Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``http``
 Flag indicating if the repository will be served over a non-SSL connection.
 Valid values to this option are ``True`` and ``False``.

``https``
 Flag indicating if the repository will be served over an SSL connection. If
 this is set to true, the ``https_ca`` option should also be specified to ensure
 consumers bound to this repository have the necessary certificate to validate
 the SSL connection. Valid values to this option are ``True`` and ``False``.

``relative_url``
 Relative path at which the repository will be served.

Optional Configuration Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``protected``
 Protect the published repository with repo authentication. Valid values to this
 option are ``True`` and ``False``.

``auth_cert``
 Certificate that will be provided to consumers bound to this repository. This
 certificate should contain entitlement information to grant access to this
 repository, assuming the repository is protected. The value to this option must
 be the full path to the certificate file. The file must contain both
 the certificate itself and its private key.

``auth_ca``
 CA certificate that was used to sign the certificate specified in ``auth-cert``.
 The server will use this CA to verify that the incoming request's client certificate
 is signed by the correct source and is not forged. The value to this option
 must be the full path to the CA certificate file.

``https_ca``
 CA certificate used to sign the SSL certificate the server is using to host
 this repository. This certificate will be made available to bound consumers so
 they can verify the server's identity. The value to this option must be the
 full path to the certificate.

``gpgkey``
 GPG key used to sign RPMs in this repository. This key will be made available
 to consumers to use in verifying content in the repository. The value to this
 option must be the full path to the GPG key file.

``generate_sqlite``
 Boolean flag to indicate whether or not sqlite files should be generated during
 a repository publish.  If unspecified it will not run due to the extra time needed to
 perform this operation.

``checksum_type``
 Checksum type to use for metadata generation

``skip``
 List of content types to skip during the repository publish.
 If unspecified, all types will be published. Valid values are: rpm, drpm,
 distribution, errata, packagegroup.
