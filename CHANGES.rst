3.20.0 (2023-05-05)
===================


Features
--------

- The package upload feature was changed to allow the upload of packages which are already
  uploaded - in this scenario, the API will display the existing package as if it had just
  been created.
  `#2764 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2764>`__
- Added the ability to replicate RPM distributions/repositories from an upstream Pulp instance.
  `#2995 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2995>`__
- Added a new setting ``RPM_METADATA_USE_REPO_PACKAGE_TIME`` that will set the primary.xml timestamp
  of each package to when the package was added to the repo rather than when the package first
  appeared in Pulp.
  `#3009 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3009>`__
- Added more filter options on the packages API.
  `#3135 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3135>`__


Bugfixes
--------

- Publish all metadata with a stable sort order. This should reduce artifact churn when certain metadata files are published repeatedly unchanged.
  `#2752 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2752>`__
- Fixed a failure that can occur during migration from 3.17 to 3.18
  `#2952 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2952>`__
- Fix a minor module metadata parsing regression that broke Pulp-to-Pulp sync in some scenarios.
  `#2961 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2961>`__
- Stopped publishing updateinfo.xml when there are no advisories.
  `#2967 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2967>`__
- Fixed 0044_noartifact_modules migration that was failing with object storage.
  `#2988 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2988>`__
- Loosen modulemd validation to allow version numbers that have string type but represent integers
  `#2998 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2998>`__
- Fixed a regression in 3.19 which resulted in unintentional API changes and problems with "depsolving" repo copy.
  `#3012 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3012>`__
- Fix import/export not importing modulemd_packages data with ManyToMany relationship.
  `#3019 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3019>`__
- Fix relative path and location href mismatch of the uploaded rpm caused by filename and rpm header mismatch. Clients are getting HTTP 404 Not Found error when downloading the rpm.
  `#3039 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3039>`__
- Fix a bug with copying modules with depsolving enabled - dependencies were not copied.
  `#3119 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3119>`__
- Fix a bug for certain repos (e.g. mercurial) relating to how modules are handled.
  `#3121 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3121>`__
- Fix an issue where the name of `UpdateCollection` is not defined and might affect import/export, and added a data repair script (`pulpcore-manager rpm-datarepair 3127`).
  `#3127 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3127>`__
- Fixes an accidental change that was made to how "profiles" are formatted in the modulemd API.
  `#3131 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/3131>`__

3.18.0 (2022-09-12)
===================


Features

- RPM metadata is now sorted by package name and version information, which slightly improves compression efficiency.
  `#2274 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2274>`__
- Make ``relative_path`` optional when uploading a package.
  `#2440 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2440>`__

  `#2456 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2456>`__
- Support Modulemd obsoletes.
  `#2570 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2570>`__
- Enabled pulp_rpm to take advantage of "create_repositories" at PulpImport time.
  `#2585 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2585>`__
- Keep modular metadata in database as a string instead of saving them to the disk.
  `#2621 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2621>`__


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed treeinfo processing to handle some very old treeinfo formats.
  `#2243 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2243>`__
- Update installation dependencies.
  `#2289 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2289>`__
- The use of `skip_types` while performing a sync under the `mirror_complete` sync policy is now disallowed. Previously it would be silently ignored instead.
  `#2293 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2293>`__
- Substantial improvements to the memory consumption of syncs, with a modest improvement in time required to sync.
  `#2296 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2296>`__
- Improved error reporting in one scenario where it could be highly confusing.
  `#2395 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2395>`__
- Added an exception for a case where repository metadata is incorrect in such a way that it should not be "mirrored", and a warning in other cases. If these warnings / errors are encountered, the party which manages the repo should be contacted. If it is a public repo, an issue can be filed in our tracker, and we will follow up with that party following confirmation of the issue.
  `#2398 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2398>`__
- Made sure that Pulp doesn't publish repos with duplicate NEVRA in some edge case scenarios.
  `#2407 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2407>`__
- Taught advisory-conflict-resolution to handle just-EVR-differences in incoming advisory's
  package-list. This solves the case of repositories that update advisories to always have
  the newest versions of RPMs (looking at you, EPEL...).
  `#2422 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2422>`__

===================


Features
--------

- Added API to allow uploading of a comps.xml file.
  `#2313 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2313>`_
- Added a per-package changelog entry limit with a default value of 10, which is controlled by a setting named `KEEP_CHANGELOG_LIMIT`. This only impacts the output of `dnf changelog $package` - it is always possible to get the full list of changelogs using `rpm -qa --changelog $package` if the package is installed on the system. This limit can yield very substantial savings time and resources for some repositories.
  `#2332 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2332>`_

  `#2316 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2316>`_
- Ensured that RPM plugin uses only a worker working directory and not /tmp which could have caused the out-of-disc-space issue since it's not expected that Pulp uses /tmp.
  `#2317 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2317>`_
- In case that only a subtree is synced, it can happen that the PRIMARY_REPO key does not exists in repo_sync_results and the sync failed with accessing a not existing key at the end.

3.16.0 (2021-10-20)
===================


Features
--------

- Added a `sync_policy` parameter to the `/sync/` endpoint which will replace the `mirror` parameter and provides additional options and flexibility about how the sync should be carried out. The `mirror` parameter is now deprecated but for backwards compatibility it will remain present.
  `#9316 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9316>`_
- Make sync optimization less sensitive to remote changes which wouldn't have any impact on the sync outcomes, and fix some situations where the sync should not be skipped.
  `#9398 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9398>`_


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed metadata generation after changing ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS.
  `#8571 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8571>`_
- For certain repos which use a rare feature of RPM metadata, "mirroring" would lead to a surprising / suboptimal result for most Pulp users. We now reject syncing these repos with mirroring enabled.
  `#9303 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9303>`_
- Fix an error that could occur when performing a non-mirror sync while using the `skip_types` option.
  `#9308 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9308>`_

- Vastly improved copy-with-depsolving performance.
  `#9387 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9387>`_
- For certain repos which use Delta RPMs (which Pulp 3 does not and will not support) we now reject syncing these repos with mirroring enabled to avoid confusing clients with unusable Delta metadata.
  `#9407 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9407>`_
- Generated .repo file now includes the "name" field.
  `#9438 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9438>`_
- Use checksum type of a package for publication if it's not configured.
  `#9448 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9448>`_
- Restored the functionality of specifying basic-auth parameters in a remote's URL.

  NOTE: it's much better to specify username/pwd explcitly on the Remote, rather
  than relying on embedding them in the URL. This fix will probably be deprecated in
  the future.
  `#9464 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9464>`_
- Fixed an issue where some repositories were unnecessarily prevented from using mirror-mode sync.

====================


Bugfixes
--------

- Taught advisory-conflict-resolution to handle just-EVR-differences in incoming advisory's
  package-list. This solves the case of repositories that update advisories to always have
  the newest versions of RPMs (looking at you, EPEL...).
  `#2422 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2422>`_
- Fix the behavior of `gpgcheck` and `repo_gpgcheck` options when specified on the repository.

====================


Bugfixes
--------

- Added an exception for a case where repository metadata is incorrect in such a way that it should not be "mirrored", and a warning in other cases. If these warnings / errors are encountered, the party which manages the repo should be contacted. If it is a public repo, an issue can be filed in our tracker, and we will follow up with that party following confirmation of the issue.

- Fixed file descriptor leak during repo metadata publish.
  (backported from #2331)
  `#2347 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2347>`_
- Added a per-package changelog entry limit with a default value of 10, which is controlled by a setting named `KEEP_CHANGELOG_LIMIT`. This only impacts the output of `dnf changelog $package` - it is always possible to get the full list of changelogs using `rpm -qa --changelog $package` if the package is installed on the system. This limit can yield very substantial savings time and resources for some repositories.

  (backported from #9580)
  `#9625 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9625>`_

  (backported from #9551)
  `#9630 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9630>`_

  (backported from #9448)
  `#9449 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9449>`_
- Restored the functionality of specifying basic-auth parameters in a remote's URL.

  NOTE: it's much better to specify username/pwd explcitly on the Remote, rather
  than relying on embedding them in the URL. This fix will probably be deprecated in
  the future.

- Fixes a regression in support for syncing from mirrorlists.
  (backported from #9329)
  `#9394 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9394>`_

  `#4012 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4012>`_
- Ensure there are no advisories with the same id in a repo version.

  if there is no way to resolve advisory conflict.
  `#4295 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4295>`_

  Creating / listing / editing / deleting RPM repositories is now performed on /pulp/api/v3/rpm/rpm/ instead of /pulp/api/v3/repositories/. Only RPM content can be present in a RPM repository, and only a RPM repository can hold RPM content.
