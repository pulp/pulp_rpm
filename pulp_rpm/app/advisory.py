    Decide which advisories to add to a repo version and which to remove, and adjust a repo version.

    Advisory can be in 3 different states with relation to a repository version:
     - in-memory and added before this function call, so it's a part of the current incomplete
       repository version only
     - in the db, it's been added in some previous repository version
     - has no relation to any repository version because it's been created in this function as an
       outcome of conflict resolution.

    All 3 states need to be handled differently.
    The in-db ones and newly created are straightforward, just remove/add in a standard way.
    To remove in-memory ones (`content_pks_to_exclude`) from an incomplete repo version,
    one needs to do it directly from RepositoryContent. They've never been a part of a repo
    version, they are also not among the `content_pks_to_add` or `content_pks_to_remove` ones.
