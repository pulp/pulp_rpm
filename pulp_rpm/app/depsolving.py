    These values are parsed by librpm.

    * rich: the name of the dependency contains all required information:

        all the other attribute values are ignored

    * generic: the name, version, epoch, release and flags attributes

    The dependency list is either of the provides, requires or the weak
    dependencies, the current case being stored under self.attr_name.

    Libsolv tracks a custom Dep object to represent a dependency of a
    solvable object; these are created in the pool object:
