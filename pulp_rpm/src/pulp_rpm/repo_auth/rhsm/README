This is a copy of the latest (10/28/2012) python-rhsm, which has v3 entitlement
certificate checking that we need. Once that feature makes it into the distros
we care about, this should all go away. Current projections are no sooner than
April, 2013.

PLEASE make any changes upstream at https://github.com/candlepin/python-rhsm
first, and then apply those changes here.

As one note, this does still depend on rhsm._certificate being available from
the original package, which should be available through the usual means.
