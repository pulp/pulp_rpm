'''
Logic for checking a client certificate's OIDs to determine if a client
should have access to a resource.

The authenticate method is the logic driver. It performs the following functions:
  - Validates the client certificate against the CA certificate assigned to the repo
  - Looks for the download URL OIDs and verifies the requested URL matches at least
    one of them

The OID structure follows the Red Hat model. Download URLs are found at:
  1.3.6.1.4.1.2312.9.2.*.1.6

The * represents the product ID and is not used as part of this calculation.
