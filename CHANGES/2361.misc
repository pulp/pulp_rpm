Added a `pulpcore-manager` management command `trim_rpm_changelogs` for the purpose of allowing the user to retroactively apply a changelog limit to already-synced packages. See the description of `KEEP_CHANGELOG_LIMIT <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_rpm/en/3.17/settings.html#keep-changelog-limit>`_ for more details. This is primarily useful for any users managing RHEL or Oracle Linux content - it can save many gigabytes of disk space and shave minutes off of publish times without significantly impacting usability.
