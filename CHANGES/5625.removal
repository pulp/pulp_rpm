Sync is no longer available at the {remote_href}/sync/ repository={repo_href} endpoint. Instead, use POST {repo_href}/sync/ remote={remote_href}.

Creating / listing / editing / deleting RPM repositories is now performed on /pulp/api/v3/rpm/rpm/ instead of /pulp/api/v3/repositories/. Only RPM content can be present in a RPM repository, and only a RPM repository can hold RPM content.
