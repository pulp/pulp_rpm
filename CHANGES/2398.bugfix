Added an exception for a case where repository metadata is incorrect in such a way that it should not be "mirrored", and a warning in other cases. If these warnings / errors are encountered, the party which manages the repo should be contacted. If it is a public repo, an issue can be filed in our tracker, and we will follow up with that party following confirmation of the issue.
