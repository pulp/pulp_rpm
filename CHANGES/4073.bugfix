Fixed a bug where syncing from a remote repository with duplicate filenames and different paths
would result in one of these packages being missing from a Pulp distribution.
This is known to happen in some JFrog repositories.

On systems that have synced from such repositories before, it is required to clean up the related
packages with orphan cleanup or use the provided "pulpcore-manager rpm-datarepair 4073",
which forces internal objects to use non-ambiguous filenames.
