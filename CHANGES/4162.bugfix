Added an AttributeError exception handling in synchronous upload API to instead raise ParseError
for malformed uploads.

The package upload endpoint now catches AttributeError exceptions that occur when files don't upload
properly or are incomplete, and raises a ParseError instead. This provides a more appropriate
HTTP 400 response for clients when upload data is malformed.
